% Ambhora Package
% The ambhora package provides things which are not essential for writing
% documents, however, make the output better. Again a good characterization is
% what cannot be in this package. This package does not contain any shortcuts
% and aliases and cannot contain color. This only contains styling. This is
% important because, removing this package is again completely possible.
% without any problem in the output. However, this makes output look good, and
% so is good for internal purposes.
