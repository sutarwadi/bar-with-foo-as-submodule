% Umred Package
% This includes only those essential things which are needed in your setup.
% Actually, a better way would be to define what should NOT go here. This
% should not include changes to style of commands, no color, no extra shortcuts,
% and especially no new command definitions.
\ProvidesPackage{umred}

% This package provides warnings when good practices are not used. Saves a lot
% of headache later.
\usepackage{nag}

% We fixed the bug in marginpars. For more details, see
% http://ctan.sharelatex.com/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mparhack/mparhack
%.pdf
\usepackage{mparhack}

% We also use xpatch to provide the more advanced patching commands
\usepackage{xpatch}

% We always need the hyperref package.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% The amsmath part is an extension package for LaTeX that provides various
% features to facilitate writing math formulas and to improve the
% typographical quality of their output.
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}

% Mathtools Package
\usepackage{mathtools}

% Com­mands to pro­duce dots in math that re­spect font size
\usepackage{mathdots}

% Split-level frac­tions in la­tex2e*
\usepackage{xfrac}

% Quotients in LaTeX
\usepackage{faktor}

% A package to cancel terms in an expressions in an effort to show computation.
\usepackage{cancel}

% Package for BigIntegrals and Other big things and shortcuts for some
\usepackage{relsize}
\usepackage{bigints}

% bbm package provides mathbb fonts for digits
\usepackage{bbm}

% Integrals with Dashes
\usepackage{esint}

% We use the ntheorem Theorem package for all its features.
%\usepackage[amsthm,framed, thmmarks]{ntheorem}
\usepackage{amsthm}

% Tools to modify theorem environments
\usepackage{thmtools}

% We use the caption package to provide options for captions in floating
% environments
\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}

% Now, we introduce the required theorem environments and other environments and
% customize them according to our preferences.
% We first define a dummy environment for tracking the counter. All math
% environments would track according to this counter.
\newtheorem{environment}{Environment}
\numberwithin{environment}{chapter}

% Firstly, we have plain/default theorems, with italic text, bold title font
\theoremstyle{plain}
\newtheorem{theorem}[environment]{Theorem}
\newtheorem{proposition}[environment]{Proposition}
\newtheorem{lemma}[environment]{Lemma}
\newtheorem{corollary}[environment]{Corollary}

% Next, we have definition and related environments
\newtheorem{axiom}[environment]{Axiom}
\newtheorem{assumption}[environment]{Assumption}
\newtheorem{definition}[environment]{Definition}
\newtheorem{example}[environment]{Example}
\newtheorem{problem}[environment]{Problem}

% Now, we have low profile things like remarks.
\theoremstyle{remark}
\newtheorem{remark}[environment]{Remark}
\newtheorem{note}[environment]{Note}

%% Equations and Changes
% Sometimes, we want to group equations and then have nested numbering for them
% The following code does that.
% It uses the command \patchcmd from etoolbox and needs amsmath to modify the
% equation numbering.
\patchcmd{\subequations}{\alph{equation}}{\alph{equation}}{}{}
\newenvironment{equationgroup}{}{}
\AtBeginEnvironment{equationgroup}{\subequations}
\AtEndEnvironment{equationgroup}{\endsubequations}
